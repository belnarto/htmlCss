<ul>
    <li>JPG image format is great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don’t
        allow for transparent pixels. <img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt="jpg"/>
    </li>
    <li>GIFs are good for animations. <img src='images/mochi.gif' alt="gif"/></li>
    <li>PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated, like diagrams, icons, etc. <img
            src='images/mochi.png' alt="png"/></li>
    <li>SVGs are vector based. Use them wherever you can. <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt="svg"/></li>
</ul>

<p>By default, the img element uses the inherit dimensions of its image file.</p>
<p>For example 150*150 for this image is inherited:</p>
<img src="images/mochi.png" alt="150*150"/>
<p>We can scale it dimension proportionally by setting only one dimension, for example width=75:</p>
<img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="width 75"/>
<p>If we set two dimensions image could be scratched, for example width=75, height=50:</p>
<img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" height="50" alt="width 75, height=50"/>
<p>The width and height attributes can be useful, but it’s usually better to set image dimensions with CSS so you can
    alter them with media queries.</p>

<p>It's better for any img element to have text alternative attribute. It would help search engines and people which
    uses browser without images (blind people).</p>
<img src="images/mochi.png" alt="this is text alternative"/>
